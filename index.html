    <p>About Me</p>
    <p>Welcome. My name is Daniel Bloch and thank you for viewing my site. To learn a little about my self, I would like to keep it simple while showing you a brief sample of my life. I grew up in West Palm Beach Florida with a total family of 5, born on the day November 27th, 1998. I attended Boca Raton Community High School and was highly active in the Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps. I competed nationally in armed drill exhibition, running, and sit-ups. Locally, I participated iin cyber-warfare competitions that deemed my fond understaning in computer architecture, my team placed first in the state. NJROTC was an interesting experience that taught me self-displine and to also never give up on myself. On the weekends, I played competitive paintball and competed for National Title across the state. </p>
    <p>I discovered my career in college. I originally attended the University of Central Florida where I recieved my associates. For campus involvement opportunites, I was an executive member of Delta Upsilon Fraternity. I reorganized the fratenity's database, created a website, as well as gave clear communiaction to the organization members weekly. During my time at the university, I worked at job at Lockheed Martin as a fincanical analyst. I programmed with microsoft visual basic auidtor and made my work extremly efficient. I recieved my associates on July, 2021. </p>
    <p>Currently, I am studying at Florida Atlantic University for Physics and Computer Science. I transfered because I came across better opportuniteis such as more resources and lower tuition so it was an offer I had to take.</p>
    <p>My goal for the future is I want to take what I have learned throughout my life and education and really just make a contribution to society. I am grateful to be living this wonderful life, and I hope can bring that energy to others and my work. Thank you.</p>
