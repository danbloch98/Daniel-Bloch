    <p>About Me</p>
    <p>Welcome. My name is Daniel Bloch and thank you for viewing my site. To learn a little about myself, I would like to keep it simple while showing you a brief sample of my life. I grew up in West Palm Beach Florida with a total family of 5, born on the day November 27th, 1998. I attended Boca Raton Community High School and was highly active in the Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps. I competed nationally in armed drill exhibitions, running, and sit-ups. Locally, I participated in cyber-warfare competitions that deemed my fond understanding of computer architecture, my team placed first in the state. NJROTC was an interesting experience that taught me self-discipline and to never give up on myself. On the weekends, I played competitive paintball and competed for the National Title across the state.  </p>
    <p>Currently, I am studying at Florida Atlantic University for Physics and Computer Science. I transfered because I came across better opportuniteis, so it was an offer I had to take.</p>
    <p>My goal for the future is I want to take what I have learned throughout my life and education and really just make a contribution to society. I am grateful to be living this wonderful life, and I hope can bring that energy to others and my work. Thank you.</p>
